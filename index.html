         For my school's internship program, I was able to create a website for a local business.
         Although Shopify's drag-and-drop editor meant that many sections were premade, there was still a lot of programming 
         involved, such as adding specific customizations and a weekly rotation of meals. Surprisingly, some of the most time-consuming parts of the project
         were putting two products side by side and adding the ability to see all of a product's images.

         The combination of a random idea I had one day and the desire to learn Python led to the creation of this project. The program counts how many syllables it takes to say a number out loud; for example, 7 is two syllables, and 345 is six syllables. It can also make a graph of how the syllables change over time. My favorite part is, due to the rules of how numbers are pronounced, the program can accept numbers up to undecillion—that's 36 zeros! <br> Made with Python.

   This was my first attempt at a "Random Scratch Project" Button. Couldn't find an API to use fetch with (that didn't have CORS security), so it isn't that good or even automatic. It was what finally got me into real coding, though, so it has a special place in my heart.<br> Made with p5.js.
