      <p class="desc">
         The combination of a random idea I had one day and the desire to learn Python led to the creation of this project. The program counts how many syllables it takes to say a number out loud; for example, 7 is two syllables, and 345 is six syllables. It can also make a graph of how the syllables change over time. My favorite part is, due to the rules of how numbers are pronounced, the program can accept numbers up to undecillion—that's 36 zeros! <br> Made with Python.

         This is a small pong game where the game scrolls up and down when the paddle moves up and down. The ball gets faster and the color changes after every bounce. It's difficult, yet very fun, and has mobile support. The combination of these factors make the game suprisingly addicting.<br> Made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

   Have you ever listened to a song while seeing a light blink or hearing a noise just out of sync with the music? That's what the Light Metronome is for! If you tap to the beat of the song, the light continues to flash at that rate. The BPM can also be set manually. While the program seems simple in concept, it was actually somewhat difficult to make. I'm very proud of it, though—especially the menu.<br> Made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

   A Punnett Square is a biology table used to illustrate all the possible outcomes of a genetic cross. This program generates one with a theoretically infinite number of different traits that can be crossed at the same time. However, after about eleven different traits the number of combonations is so large that the program freezes. Other Punnett Square generators never go higher than five, though, so I'm happy with the results. <br> Made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
